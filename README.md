# Wheat-Kernel-Classification-using-Geometric-Properties
This project focuses on classifying different wheat varieties using their geometric properties. It involves measuring seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels and utilizing machine learning models such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify wheat varieties based on these properties.
